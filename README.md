# Puppet module for installing Puppet agent, and Puppet server

Installs Puppet agent:

  * Optional class to run Puppet from Cron   - puppet::cron
  * Optional Class to run Puppet as a daemon - puppet::daemon

Optional support for install Puppet server (puppet::server)

  * Configurable support for static or git-backed dynamic environments (requires puppet-git module)
  * Storeconfig options (off, ActiveRecord or PuppetDB)
  * Passenger support (requires puppet-apache and puppet-passenger modules)

# Installation

## Using GIT

git clone git://github.com/theforeman/puppet-puppet.git

## Downloadable Tarball

  * http://github.com/theforeman/puppet-puppet/tarball/master

# Requirements

Only really tested on RedHat and Debian. Patches welcome for other OSes :)

# Setup

This is a parameterized class, but the defaults should get you going:

Standalone agent:

    echo include puppet | puppet --modulepath /path_to/extracted_tarball

Agent and cron (or daemon):

    echo include puppet, puppet::cron | puppet --modulepath /path_to/extracted_tarball

Agent and server:

    echo include puppet, puppet::server | puppet --modulepath /path_to/extracted_tarball

# Customization

As a parameterized class, all the configurable options can be overridden from your
wrapper classes or even your ENC (if it supports param classes). For example:

    # You want to use git?
    class { '::puppet::server': git_repo => true }

    # You need need your own template for puppet.conf?
    class { '::puppet::server': 
      agent_template  => 'puppetagent/puppet.conf.core.erb',
      master_template => 'puppetserver/puppet.conf.master.erb',
    }
    class { '::puppet':
      agent_template  => 'puppetagent/puppet.conf.core.erb',
    }

    # Maybe you're using gitolite, new hooks, and a different port?
    class { '::puppet::server': 
      port              => 8141,
      git_repo          => true,
      git_repo_path     => '/var/lib/gitolite/repositories/puppet.git',
      post_hook_name    => 'post-receive.puppet',
      post_hook_content => 'puppetserver/post-hook.puppet',
    }

    # Perhaps you want to install without foreman?
    class { '::puppet::server': 
        reports        => store,
        external_nodes => undef,
    }

Look in _init.pp_ for what can be configured this way, see Contributing if anything
doesn't work.

To use this in standalone mode, edit a file (e.g. install.pp), put in a class resource,
as per the examples above, and the execute _puppet apply_:

    cat > install.pp <<EOF
    class { '::puppet': }
    class { '::puppet::server': git_repo => true } 
    EOF
    puppet apply install.pp --modulepath /path_to/extracted_tarball
